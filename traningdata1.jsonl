This might be because of an internal capacity constraint, or an internal error.\nSome flow log records may be skipped during the aggregation interval (see log-status in Available fields). This may be caused by an internal AWS capacity constraint or internal error.

{"input": "TCP-flag-value\nIf no supported flags are recorded, the TCP flag value is 0. For example, since tcp-flags does not support logging ACK or PSH flags, records for traffic with these unsupported flags will result in tcp-flags value 0. If, however, an unsupported flag is accompanied by a supported flag, we will report the value of the supported flag. For example, if ACK is a part of SYN-ACK, it reports 1,. And if there is a record like SYN+ECE, since SYN is a supported flag and ECE is not, the TCP flag value is ,. If for some reason the flag combination is invalid and the value cannot be calculated, the value is '-'. If no flags are sent, the TCP flag value is 0.\nTCP flags can be OR-ed during the aggregation interval. For short connections, the flags might be set on the same line in the flow log record, for example, 19 for SYN-ACK and FIN, and , for SYN and FIN. For an example, see TCP flag sequence.\nFor general information about TCP flags (such as the meaning of flags like FIN, SYN, and ACK), see TCP segment structure on Wikipedia.\nParquet data type: INT"}
