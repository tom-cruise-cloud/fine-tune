This may be caused by an internal AWS capacity constraint or internal error. If you are using AWS Cost Explorer to view VPC flow log charges and some flow logs are skipped during the flow log aggregation interval, the number of flow logs reported in AWS Cost Explorer will be higher than the number of flow logs published by Amazon VPC.Security group and network ACL rulesIf you're using flow logs to diagnose overly restrictive or permissive security group rules or network ACL rules, be aware of the statefulness of these resources. Security groups are stateful â€” this means that responses to allowed traffic are also allowed, even if the rules in your security group do not permit it. Conversely, network ACLs are stateless, therefore responses to allowed traffic are subject to network ACL rules.For example, you use the ping command from your home computer (IP address is 203.0.113.12) to your instance (the network interface's private IP address is 172.31.16.139). Your security group's inbound rules allow ICMP traffic but the outbound rules do not allow ICMP traffic. Because security groups are stateful, the response ping from your instance is allowed. Your network ACL permits inbound ICMP traffic but does not permit outbound ICMP traffic. Because network ACLs are stateless, the response ping is dropped and does not reach your home computer. In a default flow log, this is displayed as two flow log records:An ACCEPT record for the originating ping that was allowed by both the network ACL and the security group, and therefore was allowed to reach your instance."
